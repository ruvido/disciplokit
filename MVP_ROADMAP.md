# Disciplo MVP: Hyper-Focused Roadmap üéØ

## üèóÔ∏è **Priority #1: Database Schema Redesign** (MUST DO FIRST)

### **New Clean Schema Design**

#### **Platform Level (members collection)**
```javascript
members: {
  id,
  email,
  name,
  admin: false,        // Platform admin privileges
  banned: false,       // Platform-wide ban (admin only)
  telegram: {          // Telegram integration data
    id: "",
    username: "",
    name: ""
  },
  data: {              // Custom signup form data
    // Any custom fields from signup forms
  },
  created (auto),      // PocketBase auto timestamp
  updated (auto)       // PocketBase auto timestamp
}
```

#### **Group Level (group_members junction collection)**
```javascript
group_members: {
  id,
  member_id (relation to members),
  group_id (relation to groups),
  moderator: false,    // Group moderator privileges
  status: "pending|active|left",  // Group participation flow
  invited_by (relation to members, optional),
  created (auto),      // When they joined/requested
  updated (auto)       // Last status change
}
```

### **Key Changes from Current Implementation**
1. **Replace bidirectional arrays** with proper junction table
2. **Move telegram data** from separate fields to `telegram` object
3. **Platform-wide ban** in members (not group-specific)
4. **Clean status flow** for group membership
5. **Separate concerns**: Platform admin vs Group moderator

### **Migration Tasks**
- [ ] Create new `group_members` collection
- [ ] Migrate existing member-group relationships
- [ ] Update all PocketBase hooks to use new schema
- [ ] Update frontend queries and components
- [ ] Update bot logic for group member management
- [ ] Remove old bidirectional array fields
