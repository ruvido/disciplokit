## üî• **Priority Implementation Plan**

### **PHASE 1: Admin Approval Flow** (IMMEDIATE PRIORITY)

#### **Database: New Collection - signup_requests**
```javascript
signup_requests: {
  // Initial signup info (minimal barrier)
  name: text,                    // Full name
  email: email,                  // REQUIRED for communication
  date_of_birth: date,           // Age verification
  location: select([             // Italian regions + international
    "Lombardia", "Lazio", "Campania", "Veneto", "Emilia-Romagna",
    "Piemonte", "Sicilia", "Toscana", "Puglia", "Calabria",
    "Sardegna", "Liguria", "Marche", "Abruzzo", "Friuli-Venezia Giulia",
    "Trentino-Alto Adige", "Umbria", "Basilicata", "Molise",
    "Valle d'Aosta", "Estero"
  ]),
  location_details: text,        // Only visible if location = "Estero"
  relationship_status: select(["Celibe", "Sposato", "Fidanzato"]),
  motivation: textarea,          // "Perch√© vuoi entrare nei gruppi"

  // Admin workflow

  status: select(["pending", "assigned", "reviewed", "accepted"]),
  created: date,
  updated: date
}
```
