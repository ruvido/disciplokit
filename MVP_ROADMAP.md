# Disciplo MVP: Hyper-Focused Roadmap ðŸŽ¯

## ðŸ”¥ **Critical MVP Features** (Absolutely Essential)

### **Core User Experience**
1. **Password Reset Flow** - Mandatory for any real platform
   - Email-based password reset workflow
   - Secure token generation and validation
   - User-friendly reset form

2. **Email Verification** - Security essential
   - Email verification on signup
   - Resend verification email functionality
   - Block unverified users from accessing platform

3. **Profile Editing** - Users must edit basic info
   - Edit name, email, telegram username
   - Update profile photo/avatar
   - Change password functionality

4. **Update core logic for updated member user structure**
   - i updated the collection member structure:
   - telegram_name, telegram_id, telegram_username are removed
   - when signup up hook should create data.telegram.name="" ecc unless they are fed as flag in the url
   - added the groups array which points to groups collection listing the groups the member belongs to (so i added members collection in groups as well to list the members in the group;) -> is this approach best practice? we need to know who belongs to what

4. **Dashboard onboarding flow** - Users go to groups page first
   - if they are not connected to telegram (data.telegram is empty) then just show a big centered telegram login widget
   - if they are connected to telegram -> show the list of groups
